# Theater Kickstarter Analysis

## Overview of Project

### After nearly meeting her fundraising goal for her new play _Fever_, Louise requested information on the outcomes of other plays according to their fundraising launch dates and funding goals. The analysis that follows will help Louise determine the best month to start a fundraising plan and the monetary goal with the most likely success for future plays.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Starting with a data set of Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2017 across 21 countries and a wide variety of categories, the YEAR function was used to extract the year each project was started from the "Date Created Conversion" column. Next, a pivot table was created and filtered showing successful, failed, and canceled theatrical projects according to the month of the year fundraising began. More specifically, "Date Created Conversion" was selected for the rows, "outcomes" was selected for the columns, and "Years" and "Parent Category" were chosen as filters. Blanks were filtered out of the data and the columns were sorted to show the successful data first followed by failed and canceled. Finally, the "Parent Category" was filtered to only display "theater".  The line graph shown below was created out of this pivot table data.

### Taking the large Kickstarter campaign data set and extracting the number of successful, failed, and canceled play projects along with their funding goals divided into 12 monetary ranges from less than $1000 to greater than $50,0000, a new table was created. In order to determine the number of successful, failed, and cancelled projects, the COUTIFS function was used. For successful plays with a fundraising goal of less than $1000, the following function was used: =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<1000",Kickstarter!$R:$R,"plays",Kickstarter!$F:$F,"successful"). Column D of the Kickstarter data sheet contains the monetary goal value, column R contains the subcategory data of which "plays" was extracted, and column F contains the outcome of the project. Additionally, this function was utilized for each monetary goal range and per outcome of failed and canceled. Using the SUM function for the successful, failed, and canceled columns, the total projects was determined for each goal range. From the created table, the percentage of total projects that were successfull, failed, and canceled were charted on the line chart below based on their fundraising goals.

### Some challenges encountered surrounded the COUNTIFS function in Excel when determining the number of successful, failed, and canceled kickstarter campaigns based on monetary goal ranges. Choosing the column by entering it in the equation as “column letter:column letter” makes it easier to ensure all data is selected than if one uses the ctrl+shift+down arrow option. If the cursor is not located at the top of the data set, it will only select the data from the cell and down. The solution for this challenge is to utilize “column letter:column letter” to ensure all data in the desired column is selected. Another challenge with the COUNTIFS function is ensuring the correct range values are entered for the goal ranges. The goal cannot be entered as something like “>=1000 and <=4999”. Instead, there can only be one criterion per range selected. That means, a range in the COUTIFS function must be two separate entries. Choose the data, then enter the first part of the range, i.e., >=1000, then choose the data again and enter the second part of the range, i.e., <=4999. The function would then look like this: =COUNTIFS(Kickstarter!$D:$D,">=1000", Kickstarter!$D:$D,"<=4999").

## Results

- The "Outcomes by Launch Month" line graph created reveals that the highest number of successful theater projects were started in the month of May, followed closely by the month of June. December turned out to be the month with the lowest success rate, followed closely by January, March, and November. It is of note that the month of October revealed to have the fifth highest number of projects started, but with the highest failure rate (43%) out of all months. To conclude, May and June are the best months to start a fundraising campaign for a theater project. 

- The "Outcomes Based on Goals" line chart revealed that projects with a fundraising goal of less than $1000 were the most successful with a success rate of 76%. Projects with a fundraising goal of $1000 to $4999 performed nearly as successfully at 73% success rate. The least successful projects, with a 0% success rate, were those with a goal of $45,000 to $49,000, followed closely by projects with a goal of greater than $50,000 (13% success rate). It is also important to note that projects with a goal of $25,000 to $34,999 had very low success rates as well. One more note, no play projects started were canceled. To conclude, a fundraising goal of less than $5000 will have the greatest likelihood of success.

- There are a few limitations to this data set. One notable limitation is that it is old. The newest data in the set is from 2017. Since the arrival of COVID and other global changes since 2017, the data may provide less accurate results if utilized today in 2022 and beyond. 

- Another limitation is that the data does not appear to account for exchange rates between country-specific currency. Therefore, fundraising goal data could be quite skewed because the values are not normalized to a single currency. The data could be filtered on only US projects and a new line graph made for Outcomes Based on Goals to get a more accurate picture of successful fundraising campaigns for plays based on the US dollar. Additionally, a graph for each of the countries could be created to show how the fundraising goals and success rates vary in different areas of the globe. Furthermore, the currency data could be normalized to reflect the values in US dollars only, and the data could be compared across countries to more accurately visualize the differences between countries based on fundraising goals and successful outcomes.
